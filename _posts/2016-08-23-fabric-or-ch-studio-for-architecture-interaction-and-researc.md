  Combining experimentation, exhibition and production, fabric | ch formulates
  new architectural proposals and produces singular livable spaces that bind
  localized and distributed landscapes, algorithmic behaviors, atmospheres and
  technologies.  Since the foundation of the studio, the architects and
  scientists of fabric | ch have investigated the field of contemporary spaces,
  from network related environments which mingle physical and digital properties
  to the interfacing of dimensions, such as their recent researches about
  “spatial interferences” and "moirés spaces".   fabric | ch’s current works
  deal with the mediation of our relation to location and distance, with climate
  and energy, with mobility and globalization in a perspective of creolization
  and spatial interbreeding.

Combining experimentation, exhibition and production, fabric | ch formulates new architectural proposals and produces singular livable spaces that bind localized and distributed landscapes, algorithmic behaviors, atmospheres and technologies.  
Since the foundation of the studio, the architects and scientists of fabric | ch have investigated the field of contemporary spaces, from network related environments which mingle physical and digital properties to the interfacing of dimensions, such as their recent researches about "spatial interferences" and "moirés spaces".   
fabric | ch's current works deal with the mediation of our relation to location and distance, with climate and energy, with mobility and globalization in a perspective of creolization and spatial interbreeding.

Partners of fabric | ch: Christian Babski, Stéphane Carion, Christophe Guignard and Patrick Keller.
