  When we set out to upgrade our Blogger Classic Template to Blogger Layouts (or
  is it Blogger Design?), we planned on streamlining the layout into just one
  column. But then we accidentally stumbled upon an embeddable personal
  artificial sun. We were instantly smitten, and knew we had to incorporate it
