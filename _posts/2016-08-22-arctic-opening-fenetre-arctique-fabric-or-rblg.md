  The aim of the project is to let appear a "second day" made of a large
  artificial ligthing, between Marseille's sunsets and sunrises, when everything
  becomes dark and quiet on the islands. This illumination will have its source
  up north, beyond the polar circle, where the sun shines 24 hours long during
  summer.
