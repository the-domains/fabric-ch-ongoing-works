  It has been a quite difficult project to achieve due to hard climatic
  conditions (40°C all day long during installation and exhibition... This was
  certainly hard for us, but even more for computers and electronic
  equipment...), but also due to the fact that the location, size of
  installation and lighting technology have changed one week prior to opening!
