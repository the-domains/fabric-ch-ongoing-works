  Rehearsals and opening of Globale Surveillance were last February and March in
  Caen (France), at the Comédie de Caen-Centre Dramatique National de Normandie
  (CDN). The play should travel to Paris for the new theater season (12-13) and
  then hopefully to other cities in France and Switzerland, before, eventually
  to travel further away and in english.
