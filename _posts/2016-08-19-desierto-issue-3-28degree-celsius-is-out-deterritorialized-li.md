  28째 Celsius is the temperature at which protection becomes superfluous. It is
  also the temperature at which swimming pools are acclimatised. Within the
  limits of the this hygrothermal comfort zone, we do not require the
  intervention of our body's thermoregulatory mechanisms nor that of any
  external artificial thermal controls in order to feel pleasantly comfortable
  while carrying out a sedentary activity without clothing.
