  One of the things that's being recommended is that there be one place, a
  community area, which is always lighted. And then you have a second area which
  is always dark for sleep, and then you have a third area which is work, doing
  the mining, and the shifts can migrate through these geographic locations
  within the mine and, in that way, regulate the daylight cycle of the shift.
