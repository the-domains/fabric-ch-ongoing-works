  I-Weather is an international consortium created in 2001 that has set itself
  the goal of creating the world's first artificial climate to satisfy the
  metabolic and physiological requirements of a human being in an environment
  partially or completely removed from earthly influences: mediated reality,
  networks and netlag, the disruption of the body clock that comes with air
  travel, as well as with extra-terrestrial trips and holidays.
