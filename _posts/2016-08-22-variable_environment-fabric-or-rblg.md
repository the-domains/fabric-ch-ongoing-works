  Over the past year, i've spent an impressive amount of time ogling a blog
  called Variable_environment. It had all the key ingredients that get my
  attention: pictures (many, lavish, big, most of them snapped by Milo Keller),
  inspiring collaborators (including architect Philippe Rahm, multimedia
  designer Ben Hooker, researcher and designer Rachel Wingfield and architect
  Christophe Guignard), mini robotic guest stars, and great content.
