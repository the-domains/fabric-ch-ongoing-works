  The exhibition â€žPoetics and Politics of Data" addresses the paradigm of a
  data-driven society and reflects life in an increasingly datified world. In
  visionary future scenarios, scientists enthuse over a world in which
  algorithms take over managing processes, envisioning a highly sensory and
  datafied space for us to live in, a world in which our desires and activities
  are anticipated, long before we carry them out.
